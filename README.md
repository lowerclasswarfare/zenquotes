# zenquotes
Quote generator written in Go. Grabs quotes from https://zenquotes.io \
Uses charmbracelet/lipgloss library for pretty output https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss 

Right now it only prints the quote of the day. I'm planning to add random, and quotes by person soon.

## Quick Start

git clone https://github.com/lowerclasswarfare/zenquotes.git \
go get https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss \
go build zenquotes.go \
./zenquotes \
